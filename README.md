# SMSS
Demo app that send SMS throu a private sms gateway.

Worked 3 days on hard mode to do this unfinished and unpolished android app.

In a nutshell, it send POSTs to a private api.

So just in case you depleded the SMS resources, use this app ti send more.


Let it be known that git commands are weird and even idiotic.

I've spent hours to upload this app.

Git complained a lot about things that doesn't exists while they do exists and about existing things that in reality doesn't exist.
Even Apache module mod_rewrite with that alien regex is easier to understand, Jeez.
